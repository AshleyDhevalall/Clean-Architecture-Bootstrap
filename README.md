What happens

We use 

install the net global tools

scan sonar scanner to scan our project as it builds.

the project will be automatically created in sonarqube server.

if any steps fails, the script aborts

the build logs are stored in the logs folder.


dotnet to build the solution, which explicity performs a restore

stop sonar scanner

run unit tests

the testresults folder contains the code coverage and unit test results, if you have included any unit tests.

what benefit do we get from using these tools

what do they do

how do we see the results

what is the minimum standard i should be aiming for





We will be using the Clean Architecture solution by Jason Taylor in our sample.
